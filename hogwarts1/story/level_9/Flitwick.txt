Next week is will be finals. And while some of the other teachers may be teaching you some things that you will need for the test, I wanted to take this time to have a little fun and show you one spell that can you show you the joy of charm work.

Try this:

$ \e[95mcurl wttr.in/~Kilimanjaro\e[0m

And to get your own personal weather try:

$ \e[95mcurl wttr.in/London\e[0m

but obviously with the name of your city in place of London.

For me personally, I usually don't need the weather for more than one day, so I usually use:

$ \e[95mcurl wttr.in/London?1\e[0m

Hope you had fun with that!

Next week will be \e[31mfinals\e[0m!
