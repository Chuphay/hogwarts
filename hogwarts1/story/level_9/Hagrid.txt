I really miss my wand, one thing that I found that was really useful was the two commands \e[96m<ctrl> + a\e[0m and \e[96m<ctrl> + e\e[0m. These can make navigating along long spells much more easy.

For example, try this

$ \e[95mCat "A really long sentence"\e[0m

Ooops, just noticed that \e[96mcat\e[0m is spelled with all lower case letters, well, no problem, simply type \e[96m<ctrl> + a\e[0m to go back to the beginning of the spell, and fix up that problem.

Ooops, now I notice that all sentences should end with a period, no problem, simply type \e[96m<ctrl> + e\e[0m to go to the end of the sentence.
