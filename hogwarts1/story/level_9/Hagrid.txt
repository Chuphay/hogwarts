How are your finals going? Did you study hard for them?

Last time I told you about the up and down keys, and how they could scroll through your history, well did you know that if you cast \e[96mhistory\e[0m with your wand, you can see all of your history at the same time?

Try this:

$ \e[95mhistory\e[0m

Good luck on your finals
