Welcome! Welcome!

This is your first charms class. I will be your professor. Professor Flitwick!

Obviously the terminal is your wand and the wand is the tool you use to cast spells.

Spell Casting Area: The spell casting area is just blank space. Any blank space after the prompt is where the letters you type will be displayed. Itâ€™s in this blank space that you will be casting your spells.

Read instructions carefully... remember it's laviosa not laviosa. if you mess up an invocation it isn't going to work, double check your spelling (pronounciation). Magic is one of those things where you really need to be exact, mis-pronouncing a spell usually will end up with nothing happening. So pay attention!

Almost all spells follow the same recipe. The name of the spell followed by the target of the spell (and as you get more advanced, we will learn how to add additional options to the spell):

$ \e[95mspell -options target\e[0m

Where the $ sign represents the prompt.

Ok. Let's learn our first spell \e[96mecho\e[0m . As the name might suggest, this spell repeats the target of the spell. For example try:

$ \e[95mecho Hello\e[0m 

some people prefer to put quotations around the words, try this:

$ \e[95mecho "I am learning magic!"\e[0m

Remember practice makes perfect
