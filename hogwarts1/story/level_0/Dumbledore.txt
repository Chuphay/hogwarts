Hope you had a productive first week!

I should be the last person you talk to every week, because I will advance you to the next week when you are finished.

Usually, I will check your homework, but this week, since there was none, I will simply remind you of the spells you have learned, and ask you to make sure that you are ready to continue on.

You have learned three new spells this week:

\e[96mecho\e[0m which repeats the target of the spell

\e[96mwhereami\e[0m which tells you your current location

\e[96mcat\e[0m which prints the target of a spell, usually used on .txt files

Finally, Hagrid told you about \e[96mcd ~\e[0m which will quickly bring you back to your dorm room.
