Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts. Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back. You have been warned.

What is transfiguration you ask? 

Let me compare it to charms

With a charm you add properties to something. With a transfiguration you change its nature completely; the molecular structure alters. It is possible to change inanimate objects into animate ones and vice versa.

In this class you will be learning how to change not only objects, but you will also learn how to change yourself. 

You will learn how to change your surroundings and how to change even time itself!

Because of the seriousness of this magic, we will proceed slowly.

In order to change something you must know about the thing you are going to change first!

Let us start with our surroundings. A first, most natural question is, where am I?

To find the answere to that we must simply use the spell \e[96mwhereami\e[0m . Try this with your wand:

$ \e[95mwhereami\e[0m

If you have performed the spell correctly, it should show you were you are.

This is an important spell, not only for transfiguration, but in case if you ever get lost.
