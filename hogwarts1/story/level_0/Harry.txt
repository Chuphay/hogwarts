Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking out that grubby little package. Had that been what the thieves were looking for? 

I think that none of the lessons I've had so far had given me as much to think about as tea with Hagrid. 

Had Hagrid collected that package just in time? Where was it now? And did Hagrid know something about Snape that he doesn't want to tell us?
