You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion maki    ng

I don't expect many of you will     understand the beauty of softly simmering cauldrons with their shimme    ring fumes or the delicate power of liquids that creep through human v    eins with the ability to either save or take a life. . . . I can teach     you how to bottle fame, brew glory, and even . . . put a stopper in d    eath. The only question is . . . are you a lazy good for nothing dunde    rhead, or are you willing and capable of learning one of the strongest     magicks in existence?
