We are still learning about using the \e[96mls -l\e[0m command, as we will for the rest of the year.

We learned last time. Besides for any additional files in your dorm room, you should see something like:

drwxrwxr-x 2 McGonagall Archmage 4096 Jan 11 11:09 \e[35mtest_directory\e[0m
-rw-rw-r-- 1 McGonagall Archmage    0 Jan 11 11:09 test.txt

But obviously with your name instead of mine, and your group will be fi, and with the current date.

We already learned that the two names refer to the owner and the group that the file belongs to. We also began to learn a bit about deciphering what the very cryptic \e[96mdrwxrwxr-x\e[0m entry means. It's a way to place various shields and protections on your files. 
  
We look at it as four columns:

\e[95m- | rw- | rw- | r--\e[0m

The first column is an indicator of what type of file it is, \e[96md\e[0m represents a directory and \e[96m-\e[0m represents a file. The next three columns are shields or protections. The first of these are the protections from the owner of the file (who we call "user"). The second of these is the protections from the group of the file (who we call "group"). And the last column represents the protections for everyone else (who we call "other").

Today, your \e[31mhomework\e[0m will be to change the group that a file belongs to. This is easy to do with the \e[96mchgrp\e[0m spell. Your \e[31mhomework\e[0m is to copy the file in your dorm room called "permissions.txt" to "my_permissions.txt" and then change the group to year_one, like this:

$ \e[95mcd ~\e[0m
$ \e[95mcp permissions.txt my_permissions.txt\e[0m
$ \e[95mchgrp first_year my_permissions.txt\e[0m
$ \e[95mls -l\e[0m
