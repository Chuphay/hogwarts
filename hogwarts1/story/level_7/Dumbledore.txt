You had homework. It was pretty complicated, because you were making your first potion.

The easiest way to do it, is go back to the potion class, and pay careful attention. If it becomes too difficult, you can follow the below directions:

$ \e[95mcd ~\e[0m
$ \e[95mecho "#!\bin\bash" > sleep.sh\e[0m
$ \e[95mecho "sleep 2" >> sleep.sh\e[0m
$ \e[95mchmod a+x sleep.sh\e[0m
