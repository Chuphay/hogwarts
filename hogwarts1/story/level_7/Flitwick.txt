Last week, we learned about putting spells in the background when you forget to use the special rune \e[96m&\e[0m. The way we do that was to use \e[96m<ctrl> + z\e[0m and then the command \e[96mbg\e[0m to put it in the background, bringing it up to the foreground is easy enough too with the command \e[96mfg\e[0m.

This week we will continue in that vein, but with more complicated options. Try this:

$ \e[95msleep 180 &\e[0m
$ \e[95msleep 180 &\e[0m
$ \e[95msleep 180 &\e[0m
$ \e[95mjobs\e[0m

You should see the following output:
/e[96m
[1]   Running                 sleep 180 &
[2]-  Running                 sleep 180 &
[3]+  Running                 sleep 180 &
/e[0m

By the way, if you found all that typing difficult, you should really see Hagrid, he usually has really good advice about how to speed up your wand usage.

Now, try this

$ \e[95mfg %2\e[0m
$ \e[95m<ctrl> + z\e[0m
$ \e[95mfg %1\e[0m
$ \e[95m<ctrl> + z\e[0m
$ \e[95mbg %2\e[0m
$ \e[95mjobs\e[0m

Did you get what we did? 

Practice, practice, practice.
