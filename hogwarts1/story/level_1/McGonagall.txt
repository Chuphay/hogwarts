Last time we learned how to find out our location with the spell \e[96mwhereami\e[0m

An equally important spell is to know who you are. If you are good at guessing, you might guess that the correct incantation is

$ \e[95mwhoami\e[0m

Try that.

You do have \e[31mhomework\e[0m this week!

Let me first tell you what your homework is, and then I'll will give you a helpful hint to help you complete it.

Your homework is to create a file in your dorm room called my_name.txt

Inside that text file you should write your name.

Sounds straight-forward enough? 

Here's the helpful hint

Try 

$ \e[95mecho whoami\e[0m

notice it probably doesn't work quite as you expect. To make the spell work correctly you must use the special rune \e[96m`\e[0m which is known as the backtick character and can be found near the 1 on most wands.

Try the following:

$ \e[95mecho `whoami`\e[0m

Good luck on your homework
