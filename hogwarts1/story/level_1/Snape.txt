A game.

You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion maki    ng

I don't expect many of you will     understand the beauty of softly simmering cauldrons with their shimme    ring fumes or the delicate power of liquids that creep through human v    eins with the ability to either save or take a life. . . . I can teach     you how to bottle fame, brew glory, and even . . . put a stopper in d    eath. The only question is . . . are you a lazy good for nothing dunde    rhead, or are you willing and capable of learning one of the strongest     magicks in existence?"

wouldn't be brewing anything that lesso    n. They would be learning how to use the equipment and the techniques     needed to chop, cut, slice, and dice properly

last time you learned the \e[96mcat\e[0m spell, which lets you view the contents of a potion.

However, some potions are very long and detailed. And \e[96mcat\e[0m simply won't work. We therefore use \e[96mless\e[0m as the preferred spell to slowly scroll through the contents of a potions.

To exit \e[96mless\e[0m type the rune \e[96mq\e[0m. For bonus points. Instead of using the arrows to scroll up and down use the two runes \e[96mj\e[0m and \e[96mk\e[0m. These two runes will help you in advanced potion making.

Try this

$ \e[95mcat long_potion.pl\e[0m
$ \e[95mless long_potion.pl\e[0m

And then don't forget the rune \e[96mq\e[0m will exit. (sometimes typing \e[96m<esc>\e[0m a few times can't hurt.
