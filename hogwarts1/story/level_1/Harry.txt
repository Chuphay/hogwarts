Hey! You made it to Gryffindor_tower.

This is where our dorms are; you even have a dorm room that is all yours (no sharing dorms here).

When magic and everything overwhelms me, I go hide in my room by:

$ \e[95mcd dorms\e[0m
$ \e[95mls\e[0m
$ \e[95mcd Harry\e[0m

You can do the same for your dorm room -- just try to \e[96mcd\e[0m into it.

When you feel ready to face to world again, leave a room by typing \e[96mcd ..\e[0m

I'll just . . . stay here
