Hello there, mate. How are you liking Hogwarts so far?

Told you would like it.

Did you know that your wand can take you immediately back to your dorm room? I know my hut is a far hike. You can use \e[96mcd ~\e[0m to get quickly back to your dorm. 

Try:

$ \e[95mcd ~\e[0m

Ah, I miss me wand so much.

I gotta visit Gringotts fer Dumbledore. Hogwarts business. Yeh'd be mad ter try an' rob it, I'll tell yeh that. Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe.  Never mess with goblins or their banks. He usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him. Fetchin' you, gettin' things from Gringotts -- knows he can trust me, see.

I'll see yeh later.
