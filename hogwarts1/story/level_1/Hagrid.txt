Hello there mate

I gotta visit Gringotts. Wizards' bank. Run by goblins. Have a sausage, they're not bad cold 
Yeah -- so yeh'd be mad ter try an' rob it, I'll tell yeh that. Never mess with goblins. Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe -- 'cept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter o' fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway. Fer Dumbledore. Hogwarts business. He usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him. Fetchin' you, gettin' things from Gringotts -- knows he can trust me, see.

How are you liking Hogwarts so far?

Told you would like it.

Did I ever tell you, I use to have a wand? I miss it so much.

Did you know that your wand can take you immediately back to your dorm room?

I know my hut is far away from your dorm. You can use \e[96mcd ~\e[0m to get quickly back to your dorm. 

Try:

$ \e[95mcd ~\e[0m

I'm off to Gringotts now, I'll see you later.
