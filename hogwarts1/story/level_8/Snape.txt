Last week
You examined
the potion \e[96msleep.sh\e[0m
with your first cauldron \e[96mnano\e[0m

This week, you will attempt to modify
the potion, to create your own.
This is your \e[31mhomework\e[0m!
I doubt you will be able to finish

As you may be aware
you can only modify things in
your own dorm.

Thefore, you must 
copy this potion
to your dorm room.
Then modify it to sleep 
for only 2 seconds.

Remember, to exit (and to save)
in \e[96mnano\e[0m 
you must
use \e[96m<ctrl> + x\e[0m
and then follow the directions to save.

Try this:

$ \e[95mcp sleep.sh ~\ \e[0m
$ \e[95mcd ~\e[0m
$ \e[95mnano sleep.sh\e[0m

Then modify the potion to sleep for 2 seconds.
