Instead of a \e[31mfinal\e[0m, you will be reasonable for doing a final project.

Your project is to create your own potion!

Don't forget at the beginning of your potion you must add the she-bang: \e[96m#!/bin/bash\e[0m

You also must make your potion executable by using the transfiguration \e[96mchmod +x your_potion.sh\e[0m

Finally, remember that to use your potion you must evoke it like this:

$ \e[95m./your_potion.sh\e[0m

My recommendation is to start off slowly. First make sure that you can at least invoke \e[96mecho\e[0m. It is very common to start off with a script that only contains \e[96mecho "hello world"\e[0m, and then make sure it performs as expected.

Good luck!
