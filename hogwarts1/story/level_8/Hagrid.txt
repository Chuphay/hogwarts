Last time, I told ya about tab completion. Pretty useful right?

Another really useful shortcut, is using the up and down arrows.
This allows you to scroll through your history, to re-use old spells

For example try:

$ \e[95mecho hello\e[0m

Then press the up key, to see that spell become re-usable.

If you keep pressing up, you can go further back into the history of the spells you have casted. Pressing down, will reverse this process.

Have fun and practice!
