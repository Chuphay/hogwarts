You know, all that talk about giant books got me excited last week and I did some studying.

Did you know the source of all free magic comes from something called the "kernel"?

See, it says it right here:

"From the kernel, all users with the knowledge to do so can tap into magic freely as long as the kernel stays safe and open to the public. Few have seen the Source since the Great Rift, but witness accounts describe it as something that can be stored in a small, grubby package in a bank's vault somewhere."

Huh. How oddly specific.
