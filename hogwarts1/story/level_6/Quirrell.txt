W-W-Welcome back. D-D-Did you get any R-R-Rest?

I d-d-didn't. I kept on thinking there was a w-w-werewolf under my bed.

Today I will t-t-teach you a new defensive technique, especially useful for when a spell goes wrong.

It's called \e[31CONTROL C\e[0m, and it can be used by findind the control key on your keyboard and pressing that while pressing c. We usually write it as \e[96mctrl+c\e[0m.

Let's suppose you were using the \e[96msleep\e[0m spell, but you forgot to use the \e[96m&\e[0m rune... yikes, that's a bad mistake. L-L-Luckily, \e[96mctrl+c\e[0m will come to the r-r-rescue.

Try this:

$ \e[95msleep 15\e[0m
$ \e[95mctrl+c\e[0m

Practice, practice, practice!
