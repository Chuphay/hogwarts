Your homework was to create a file called permissions.txt into your dorm room, with the three types of users that can use shields.

Do you remember what they are? They are \e[96muser group other\e[0m. In other words try this:

$ \e[96mcd ~\e[0m
$ \e[96mecho "user group other" > permissions.txt\e[0m
