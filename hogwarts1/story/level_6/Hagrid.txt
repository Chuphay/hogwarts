How ya doin?

Wands are awesome! But sometimes it feels like you need to do a lot of spell casting to get anything done. Luckily, there's a way to make your spell casting faster, by using the \e[96m<tab>\e[0m key in the upper left corner of your keyboard. \e[96m<tab>\e[0m completion workd=s by letting your wand guess what you are trying to cast. For example instead of invoking my full name, when trying to talk with me, try doing this instead:

$ \e[95mHa\e[0m \e[96m<tab>\e[0m

Did that work for you? Try practicing it when you move around too:

$ \e[95m cd ho\e[0m \e[96m<tab>\e[0m
