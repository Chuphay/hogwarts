I really miss my wand. And I taught you some awesome wand commands last semester. Hopefully you found them really helpfull!

Here's a list of all the ways I taught you how to move around with just your wand:

\e[96mcd ~\e[0m sends you directly back to your dorm room
\e[96mcd ../..\e[0m lets you exit multiple rooms at a time
\e[96mcd /path/to/room\e[0m let's you go directly to a room if you know the whole path
\e[96mpushd room\e[0m and \e[96mpopd\e[0m lets you jump to a room, and then pop out back to your original location.
