Welcome to charms.

Today we are going to learn a really cool spell called \e[96msleep\e[0m

Try it:

$ \e[95msleep 5\e[0m

Pretty cool, right?

But notice how you can't do anything for ten seconds? There's a way to make a spell work in the background, so that you can cast other spells and that's with the \e[96m&\e[0m rune.

Try this 

$ \e[95msleep 20 &\e[0m

If you correctly casted your incantation, you should now immediately be able to cast a new spell.

Next week is Christmas break. After the break we will learn more about how to control multiple spells at once.
