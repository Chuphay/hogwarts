Welcome back to History class!

I hope you had a more interesting break than me... I was reading history...

today, I am going to teach you a new spell to use when a chapter is too big to read

It's called \e[96mless\e[0m

Fortunately or unfortunately, it's a little different then most of the spells you have learned previously

The main reason is that once you start it, it is a little difficult to get out

Probably because the material is so absorbing

to get out, you must press \e[96mq\e[0m

If you think you got that try

$ \e[95mless chapter_5\e[0m

and don't forget \e[31mq\[0m will get you out!

(also as a side hint, sometimes pressing \e[96mesc\e[0m a few times before \e[96mq\e[0m can help)
