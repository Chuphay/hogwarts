Hope you had a pleasant and restful Christmas break.

As I mentioned in the class, we are going to be talking about what we see when we cast \e[96mls -l\e[0m for the rest of the year. To remind ourselves, let's try an experiment in your home directory:

$ \e[95mcd ~\e[0m
$ \e[95mtouch test.txt\e[0m
$ \e[95mmkdir test_directory\e[0m
$ \e[95mls -l\e[0m

Besides for any additional files in your dorm room, you should see something like:

drwxrwxr-x 2 McGonagall McGonagall 4096 Jan 11 11:09 \e[35mtest_directory\e[0m
-rw-rw-r-- 1 McGonagall McGonagall    0 Jan 11 11:09 test.txt

But obviously with your name instead of mine, and with the current date.

We already learned that the two names refer to the owner and the group that the file belongs to. The real mystery is what is that \e[96mdrwxrwxr-x\e[0m thing all about.

Let me break it down into four columns:

\e[95md | rwx | rwx | r-x\e[0m

Now, don't worry if this doesn't make too much sense right now, we will be covering it again and again, but let's say it once. And then repeat next time.

The first column is an indicator of what type of ile it is, \e[96md\e[0m represents a directory and \e[96m-\e[0m represents a file. The next three columns are shields or protections. The first of these are the protections from the owner of the file. The second of these is the protections from the group of the file. And the last column represents the protections for everyone else.
