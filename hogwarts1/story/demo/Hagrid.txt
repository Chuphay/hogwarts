Call me Hagrid, everyone does. I'm Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts -- yeh'll know all about Hogwarts, o' course.

Wait, no? Do you mean ter tell me, that yeh know nothin' abou' -- about ANYTHING?

Yeh don' know what yeh are? Ah, go boil yer heads -- yer a wizard.

Don' yeh worry. You'll learn fast enough. Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, you'll be just fine. Yeh'll have a great time at Hogwarts -- I did -- still do, 'smatter of fact.

I love Hogwarts ... when I was a boy, I attended. Now Dumbledore, bless his heart, has allowed me to stay.

Yeh should go see Dumbledore, he's in the headmasters_office in the castle if yeh want to join.
