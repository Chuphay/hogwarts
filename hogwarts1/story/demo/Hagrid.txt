Call me Hagrid, everyone does. I'm Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts -- yeh'll know all about Hogwarts, o' course.

I knew yeh weren't gettin' yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn't even know abou' Hogwarts, fer cryin' out loud! Did yeh never wonder where yer parents learned it all?

Do you mean ter tell me, that yo know nothin' abou' -- about ANYTHING?"

About our world, I mean. Your world. My world. Yer parents' world."

Yeh don' know what yeh are? Ah, go boil yer heads -- yer a wizard.

Don' you worry, Harry. You'll learn fast enough. Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, you'll be just fine. just be yerself. I know it's hard. Yeh've been singled out, an' that's always hard. But yeh'll have a great time at Hogwarts -- I did -- still do, 'smatter of fact.
