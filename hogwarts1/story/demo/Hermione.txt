Oh hi!

Are you a new student?

You're going to love it here! So many books

So much homework! What fun

I've tried a few simple spells just for practice and it's all worked for me. Nobody in my family's magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, it's the very best school of witchcraft there is, I've heard -- I've learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough -- I'm Hermione Granger, by the way.

You should go see Dumbledore in the headmasters_office if you want to join
