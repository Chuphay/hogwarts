Welcome to Hogwarts School of Wizardry! 

My name is Professor Dumbledore, and I will be helping you learn to be a real wizard. This level is just the demo level. Take a look around, and see if you like it. If you like it, come and find me and I will set you up with a dorm room in the castle. If not, that's okay. There are many other ways to learn magic, and you may find other ways more suitable, or maybe you just might decide that magic isn't for you.

I have a few pointers to help you on your journey:

First of all, a congratulations! You made it to Hogwarts. Probably the hardest part of your journey is over. Most people can't even find a wand...

Second, have fun! Explore, experiment, and talk to whomever you meet by typing their name (don't forget, magic is case-sensitive). 

Third, don't forget the spells you have already learned. A great idea is to write them down in a notebook. Up to now, you have learned two spells:

\e[96mls\e[0m which you use to illuminate your surroundings

\e[96mssh\e[0m which is the spell you used to travel to this magical world

Finally, try not to use your mouse. It may be uncomfortable at first, but as you practice using your wand, you will gain speed and technique.

Try illuminating your surroundings and then talking to Ron by typing \e[95mRon\e[0m with your wand. Have fun!
