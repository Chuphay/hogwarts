Did you know you can type \033[96mcd\033[0m to change your location?

For example, if you want to go to gryffindor_tower, you should type 

cd \033[95m$gryffindor_tower\033[0m

There you will find Harry, you should talk to him

(\033[31mDon't\033[0m type the \033[96m$\033[0m, that represents the command prompt)
