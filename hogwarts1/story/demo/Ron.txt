Hey! I'm Ron. See you got your wand there -- I can help get you started if you'd like. I was raised with this stuff

For example, did you know you can type \033[96mcd\033[0m to change your location?

Like, if you want to go to gryffindor_tower, you should type 

$ \033[95mcd gryffindor_tower\033[0m

(But \033[31mdon't\033[0m type the \033[96m$\033[0m, that represents the command prompt)

There you'll find Harry, you should talk to him. He's new to all this magic stuff just like you

Also, you should be \e[7mcompulsively typing\e[0m \e[95mls\e[0m everywhere you go. The magic world is a dangerous place to be wandering around in the dark
