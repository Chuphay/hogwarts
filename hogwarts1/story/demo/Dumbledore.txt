Welcome to my office.

It is here that I will check your progress as you learn to become a wizard

To have gotten this far means that you are well on your way to becoming a wizard.

You have already learned four commands

\e[96mcd room_name\e[0m to enter into a room

\e[96mcd ..\e[0m to exit a room

\e[96mls\e[0m to illuminate a room

\e[96mssh\e[0m to enter into this magical realm

My recommendation is to write these spells down, so you can come back to them easily

Please do that now. Find a piece of paper, and write those commands down
