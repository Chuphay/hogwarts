Hello and welcome to Hogwarts

To have gotten this far means that you are well on your way to becoming a wizard.

You have already learned four commands

\e[96mcd room_name\e[0m to enter into a room

\e[96mcd ..\e[0m to exit a room

\e[96mls\e[0m to illuminate a room

\e[96mssh\e[0m to enter into this magical realm

I will teach you one more. But don't use it yet! Use this when you are ready to leave

It is \e[96mexit\e[0m, and it will take you away from this magical world and bring you back to your own world

My recommendation is to write these spells down, so you can come back to them easily

Please do that now. Find a piece of paper, and write those commands down
