Welcome to History class

My name is Professor Binns and I am a ghost. 

I was teaching history one day, and it was so boring that I died of boredom...

So, instead of teaching you history, I am just going to let you read the book by yourself

You will notice in this classroom, there are the first 8 chapters of a History of Wizardy

There will be no tests... 

However, after Christmas break, you should come back because I will teach you a new spell

How do you read a chapter?

Simply use the command \e[96mcat\e[0m

Like this

$ \e[95mcat chapter_1\e[0m

dont forget that the $ sign represents your prompt, try typing in the command in magenta now.
