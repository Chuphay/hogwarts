\e[0m
Welcome to the second month of your first year.

Hopefully you took a little break to let all the new stuff you're learning sink in.

To become proficient quickly, you should write everything you learn in a notebook, and perhaps even start memorizing the spells.

Previously, you have learned:

\e[96mecho\e[0m which repeats the target of the spell

\e[96mcat\e[0m which prints the target of a spell, usually used on .txt files

\e[96mls\e[0m which lists the contents of your current location

\e[96mcd\e[0m is used to change directories (locations)

\e[96mexit\e[0m which takes you out of Hogwarts

Remember, have fun. Don't use your mouse. And it's not a race, take your time and practice what you have learned.
