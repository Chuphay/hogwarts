Today you will learn a new spell and I will give you some \e[31mhomework\e[0m.

The new spell is to create a new room (make a new directory) with the following invocation \e[96mmkdir\e[0m

As usual, most spells need a target. In this case, the target is the name of the new room.

Try this in your dorm room

$ \[e95mcd ~\e[0m
$ \[e95mmkdir closet\e[0m

Your \e[31mhomework\e[0m for the day is to make a closet and put inside of it my_name.txt, the file that you created for your homework last time. Professor McGonagall will have hints on how to do that.
