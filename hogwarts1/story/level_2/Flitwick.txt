Last week we learned the important \e[96mecho\e[0m spell

Today we are going to learn two new spells, the \e[96mtouch\e[0m spell and the \e[96mcp\e[0m

Remember that spells are generally cast in the following manner

$ spell -options target

If you mess up an invocation it isn't going to work, double check your spelling. Magic is one of those things where you really need to be exact, mis-pronouncing a spell usually will end up with nothing happening. So pay attention! Finally, we will learn about options later.

\e[96mtouch\e[0m is a spell of creation. The target is the thing you want to create. 

There are protections in this castle that will not permit you to willy-nilly create things anywhere you want. You can only create things in your own dorm room. Please try this at home:

$ \e[95mcd ~\e[0m
$ \e[95mtouch test\e[0m
$ \e[95mls\e[0m

\e[96mcp\e[0m is a spell to copy files and even change their names. Try this in your dorm room:

$ \e[95mtouch file1.txt\e[0m
$ \e[95mcp file1.txt file2.txt\e[0m
$ \e[95mls\e[0m

Remember, practice makes perfect!
