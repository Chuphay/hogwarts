Transfiguration is dangerous.

Previously, we had learned who we are and where we are, two very important things to know.

But another thing to know is which groups we belong to. The group you belong to will help you access different rooms and are a way of adding protections to the castle. 

Try this:

$ \e[95mgroups\e[0m

It show that you belong to two groups, one is simply your user name, you will always belong to this group! The other says "year_one", naturally, you are a year_one student, and you can access all the rooms that year_one students can access.

After the christmas break, we will learn several shield enchantments. Some of these enchanments will be simple muggle repellents, and some will be so powerful that only a true archmage could break them. We will also learn to change objects from inanimate into animate and visa-versa... but that comes after the christmas break. For now, we must learn about groups.

But for now, practice, practice, practice!
