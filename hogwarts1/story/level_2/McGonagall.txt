Transfiguration is dangerous.

So far, you have learned \e[96mwhoami\e[0m and \e[96mwhereami\e[0m

Today we will learn two spells that transform a file: \e[96mcp\e[0m and \e[96mmv\e[0m

\e[96mcp\e[0m copies a file

\e[96mmv\e[0m moves a file

Try this in your dorm room:

$ \e[95mcd ~\e[0m
$ \e[95mtouch test_file.txt\e[0m
$ \e[95mcp test_file.txt test_file_backup.txt\e[0m
$ \e[95mls\e[0m
$ \e[95mmv test_file_backup.txt test_file2.txt\e[0m

Finally, to help you with your homework, you should learn how to move a file into a different room. It is really quite straightforward. Suppose, you have a room in your dorm room called "closet", then you would simply use the following invocation:

$ \e[95mmv test_file2.txt closet\e[0m

As always, practice makes perfect.
