D-D-Dark Arts are S-S-Scary

I am going to teach you one of the most s-s-s-scary spells there is \e[96mrm\e[0m

\e[96mrm\e[0m removes a file 

\e[96mrm\e[0m is d-d-dangerous since you cannot raise d-d-dead files from the grave!

M-M-Magic cannot bring dead people back to life... Once you’re dead, you’re dead.

Try this in your dorm room:

$ \e[95mcd ~\e[0m
$ \e[95mtouch soon_to_be_dead.txt\e[0m
$ \e[95mls\e[0m
$ \e[95mrm soon_to_be_dead.txt\e[0m
$ \e[95mls\e[0m

I think I n-n-need a glass of warm milk
