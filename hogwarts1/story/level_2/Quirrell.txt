S-S-Sorry for running away last t-t-time

S-S-S-Spells are very S-S-Scary. One of the B-B-Best ways to deal with them is to re-re-redirect them

You can redirect them by using the \e[96m>\e[0m arrow (shares a key with . on most wands)

But the q-q-question is where do you re-re-redirect the spell to? There are protections in this castle that make it impossible to redirect anywhere but for your own dorm room.

So to practice re-re-redirection you must first go back to your own dorm room.

Next you need a target where the spell will live... try this

First go to your dorm room

$ \e[95mcd ~\e[0m

then 

$ \e[95mecho "evil spell"\e[0m

then 

$ \e[95mecho "evil spell" > box.txt\e[0m

finally, you can see the contents of box.txt

$ \e[95mcat box.txt\e[0m
