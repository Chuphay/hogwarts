You have now learned two ways to view a file: \e[96mcat\e[0m and \e[96mless\e[0m. 

\e[96mcat\e[0m has the benefit of being simple and quick. \e[96mless\e[0m lets you view large files, but can be a little cumbersome.

A good in between are the dual commands \e[96mhead\e[0m and \e[96mtail\e[0m which lets you view the head and tail of a potion, respectively.

Try this (and then deduct 50 points from Gryffindor)

$ \e[95mhead long_potion.pl\e[0m
$ \e[95mtail long_potion.pl\e[0m
