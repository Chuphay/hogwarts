Having fun with your new spells?

I remember growing up my mum would tell me about some bloke who tried to take all of magic and privatize it so all wizards would have to pay to do spells and stuff.

I'm sure that was all hopping pots and hairy hearts to teach me the privilege of having magic or whatever, but it really makes you think, you know?
