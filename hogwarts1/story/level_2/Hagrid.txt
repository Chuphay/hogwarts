Hello there

Have you been practicing those wand movements I taught you?

\e[96mcd ~\e[0m to quickly go back to your dorm room

and

\e[96mcd ../../..\e[0m to exit multiple rooms at once.

They will help you move around the castle quickly.

Another wand movement that will help you quickly move around can only be used when you concentrate really hard on where you want to go.

Suppose you are in your dorm room and you want to quickly come and visit me. Since you know where I live, you can type the exact path to my hut. Try this:

$ \e[95mcd ~\e[0m
$ \e[95mcd /hogwarts1/hagrids_hut\e[0m

Hope that helps you navigate around the castle more quickly
