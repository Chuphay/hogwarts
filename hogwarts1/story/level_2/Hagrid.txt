Hi there,

Thanks for stopping by

I am pretty far from everyone else, so I appreciate it

One way you can get here faster is by chaining multiple exit spells together

Usually when you exit a room you can cast the spell \e[96mcd ..\e[0m

But if you want to exit multiple rooms at once, you can type something like

$ \e[95mcd ../..\e[0m

which will make you exit two rooms or even 

$ \e[95mcd ../../..\e[0m

which will make you exit three rooms all at once.

try it by first going back to your dorm room and then using the spell like this

$ \e[95mcd ~\e[0m
$ \e[95mcd ../../..\e[0m
$ \e[95mcd whereami\e[0m
