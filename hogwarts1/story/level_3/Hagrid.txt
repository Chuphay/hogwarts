Hi there,

Hope you have been practicing using the full path to change directories with your wand, using the command \e[96mcd path/to/directory\e[0m.

I really miss my wand.

When I use to have one, one of my favorite tricks was to pop in and out of a room. The way we do that is by using \e[96mpushd\e[0m to go into a directory and \e[96mpopd\e[0m to pop out.

Try this:

$ \e[95mcd ~\e[0m
$ \e[95mpushd /hogwarts1/hagrids_hut\e[0m
$ \e[95mwhereami\e[0m
$ \e[95mpopd\e[0m
$ \e[95mwhereami\e[0m
