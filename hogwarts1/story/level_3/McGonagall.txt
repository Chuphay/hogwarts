As a prelude of what is to come after the Christmas break, we will begin with some \e[1mvery advanced\e[0m magic. Please do not feel overwhelmed, becasue we will be talking about this lesson for the rest of the year.

Previously, we had learned who we are and where we are, two very important things to know. We also learned about which groups we belonged to, which is an important thing in the realm of magic.

Today we will learn our first spell with an \e[31moption\e[0m

We all already know what \e[96mls\e[0m does - it lists the content of your current location. But if we give it an option, it will also show the owner and the group each room belongs to. We do this by providing the option \e[96m-l\e[0m which stands for long. Try this:

$ \e[95mcd /hogwarts1/hogwarts_castle\e[0m
$ \e[95mls -l\e[0m

You should now see a lot more information about each file in hogwarts_castle. Do \e[1mnot\e[0m be overwhelmed, we will go over most of the main parts of what you see over the rest of the year. For example, you should see:

drwxr-xr-x 2 dumbledore year_one 4096 Jan 10 10:29 library

Pay particular attention to where it says "year_one". This means that anyone in the group "year_one" can access the library, like you. However, 

drwxr-x--- 2 dumbledore archmage 4.0K Jan 10 10:29 second_floor

This line says that onlly an "archmage" can access the second_floor. Since you are not an archmage, you cannot access this level.

Next week is Christmas, so no homework this week!
