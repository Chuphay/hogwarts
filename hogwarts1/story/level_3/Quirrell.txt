L-L-Last time we learned the d-d-dark spell \e[96mrm\e[0m

This time we are going to learn the equally d-d-dark spell \e[96mrmdir\e[0m

As you may be able to tell from the name this spell removes a directory, or in other words, deletes a whole room.

Try this:

$ \e[95mcd ~\e[0m
$ \e[95mmkdir dead_room\e[0m
$ \e[95mls\e[0m
$ \e[95mrmdir dead_room\e[0m

A note on the use of this s-s-spell, it only works if the room is already empty.
