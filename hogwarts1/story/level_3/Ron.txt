Wait, you're dueling with Malfoy?

The most I know about dueling is what my parents told me. Something about a Bill Doors or Gates or whatever and a Ken Thompson dueling and causing a massive rift through the wizarding community, dividing all masgic users forever ...

Ah! Erm, your thing is way different though. The most you and Malfoy'll be able to do is send
sparks at each other. Neither of you knows enough magic to do any real
damage. I'm sure it'd be ... fine.
