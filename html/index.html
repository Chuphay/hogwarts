<h1>Welcome to Hogwarts</h1>

<h3><i>You've been selected to join Hogwarts School of Wizardry!</i></h3>

<p>The first year at Hogwarts is a crash course in using your wand (the command line) to perform magic (make your computer perform tasks). It is designed to get you barely capable enough to start using your wand like a real wizard does. When you're done with the first year, you will be able to cast most of the basic spells that every wizard uses every day.</p>

<p>To get started, you will have one day to explore the Hogwarts campus -- a demo day. If you like it there, you can enroll into the first year course, by talking with Professor Dumbledore</p>

<p>To come to Hogwarts, you will first need to find your wand. They can go after different names: terminal, console, power shell. Check out this page to help <a href="wand.html">find your wand</a>. If you can't find a wand, then you can't go to Hogwarts...</p>

<p>After finding your wand, it is time to cast your first spell. We will learn how to illuminate our surroundings. In Rowling's world, to illuminate the end of a wand, the caster must call out the incantation "Lumos." But in the real world of magic we simply type <b>ls</b> </p>

<code>ls</code>

<p>Try typing that in to your wand (terminal/console/shell). If correctly incanted, the end of the wand will then illuminate and cast light in the immediate vicinity of the caster. </p>

<p>If you've come this far, then you probably have enough native talent to become a powerful wizard. Now, it is time to travel to the wizarding world... (don't forget what you've already learned -- <b>write it down!!!!</b>). Invoke the following spell using your wand:</p>

<code>ssh demo@hogwarts.tech</code>

<p>The password is <b>"secret"</b>. Type secret when you are prompted to provide a password. In the wizarding world, your password will be invisible, and you will not be able to see the characters as you type them in.</p>

<h3>Have fun at Hogwarts!</h3>
