<h1>Welcome to Hogwarts</h1>

<img src="hogwarts.jpg" alt="hmm...">

<h2><i>You've been selected to join Hogwarts School of Wizardry and Bash!</i></h2>

<p>The first year at Hogwarts is a crash course in using your wand (the command line) to perform magic (make your computer perform tasks). It is designed to get you barely capable enough to start using your wand like a real wizard does.</p>
 
<p>After finishing the first year, you will know enough magic to perform most every-day spells with your wand. The year is broken up into a fall semester and a spring semester, each of which have four months (most muggle-borns take about a day to get through each month).</p>  

<p>To get started, you will have one day to explore the Hogwarts campus -- a demo day. If you like it there, you can enroll into the first year course and get your own dorm room!</p>

<p>Before getting started, allow me to introduce to your Professors</p>

  <img src="flitwick.jpg"/> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><i>Filius Flitwick.</i></b> Professor Flitwick teaches charms. Charms are the bread-and-butter of all wizardry. A charm is a controlled manifestation of magic that affects the world, such as levitating objects, conjuring fire or water, or stunning an individual. Generally cast by a witch or a wizard, spells are often produced with an incantation, and may appear as jets of light. The action of performing a spell is referred to as casting or spellwork. </p>

<div class="prof">
  <img src="mcgonagall.jpg"/> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><i>Minerva McGonagall.</i></b>  Deputy Headmistress and Professor of Transfiguration. Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts. With a charm you add properties to something. With a transfiguration you change its nature completely; the molecular structure alters. It is possible to change inanimate objects into animate ones and vice versa. In this class you will be learning how to change not only objects, but you will also learn how to change yourself. You will learn how to change your surroundings and how to change even time itself!</p>

  <img src="quirrell.jpg" /> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><i>Quirinus Quirrell.</i></b> In this class, students study and learn how to defend themselves against all aspects of the Dark Arts, including dark creatures, curses, hexes and jinxes (dark charms), and duelling. In the first year, you will learn how to redirect spells that may be directed at you. You will learn several different ways of stopping spells that have already been cast.</p>

  <img src="snape.jpeg" /><p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><i>Severus Snape.</i></b> Potions are magical mixtures commonly brewed in cauldrons and used to create a number of magical effects on the drinker. Potions range in effects, nature, and brewing difficulty. Because of the difficulty of potion making, in the first year, you will mostly learn about how to use the equipment and the techniques needed to chop, cut, slice, and dice properly.</p>

<div class="prof">
  <img src="hagrid.jpg" /> <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>Rubeus Hagrid.</i></b> Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts. Although not a true Professor, you may find that frequent visits to Hagrid's Hut will pay off. He knows a lot about the magic world and he can share many tips on how to use your wand.</p>

<div class="prof">
  <img src="dumbledore.jpeg" /> <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>Albus Dumbledore.</i></b> Headmaster (Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock, Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards) Albus Dumbledore is the headmaster of Hogwarts and will be guiding you through your stay. After you talk with everyone else in a level, you should come and see him in his office. Dumbledore will review your progress and let you continue on if he thinks you've done well enough.</p>

<h2>Join the Demo</h2>

<p>To come to Hogwarts, you will first need to find your wand. They can go after different names: terminal, console, power shell. Check out this page to help <a href="wand.html">find your wand</a>. If you can't find a wand, then you can't go to Hogwarts...</p>

<p>After finding your wand, it is time to cast your first spell. We will learn how to illuminate our surroundings. In Rowling's world, to illuminate the end of a wand, the caster must call out the incantation "Lumos." But in the real world of magic we simply type <b>ls</b> </p>

<code>ls</code>

<p>Try typing that in to your wand (terminal/console/shell). If correctly incanted, the end of the wand will then illuminate and cast light in the immediate vicinity of the caster. </p>

<p>If you've come this far, then you probably have enough native talent to become a powerful wizard. Now, it is time to travel to the wizarding world... (don't forget what you've already learned -- <b>write it down!!!!</b>). Invoke the following spell using your wand:</p>

<code>ssh demo@hogwarts.tech</code>

<p>The password is <b>"secret"</b>. Type secret when you are prompted to provide a password. In the wizarding world, your password will be invisible, and you will not be able to see the characters as you type them in.</p>

<h3>Have fun at Hogwarts!</h3>
