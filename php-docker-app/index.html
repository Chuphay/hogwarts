<h1>Welcome to Hogwarts</h1>

<p>You've been selected to join Hogwarts school of Wizardry!</p>

<p>The first year at Hogwarts is a crash course in using your wand (the command line) to perform magic (make your computer perform tasks). It is simply designed to get you barely capable enough to start using your wand (computer) like a real wizard (programmer) does. When you're done with the first year, you will be able to cast most of the basic spells (commands) that every wizard (shell user) uses every day.</p>

<p>To get started you will start on a demo day. One day to explore the Hogwarts campus</p>

<p>If you like it there, you can enroll into the first year course, by talking with Dumbledore</p>

<p>Your task is to first find your wand. They can go after different names: terminal, console, power shell. If you can't find a wand, then you probably can't go to Hogwarts....</p>

<p>After finding your wand. Let's learn your first spell. In Rowling's world they call it lumos, or make light, we shorten that to:</p>
<p>To illuminate the end of a wand, the caster must call out the incantation "Lumos." (ls)  If correctly incanted, the end of the wand will then illuminate and cast light in the immediate vicinity of the caster. It can also be used to illuminate unseen entrances.</p>
<code>ls</code>

<p>Try typing that in to your wand (terminal/console/shell) (P.S. If you are using powershell, your first spell will not work, but do not fear, when you come to hogwarts the spell will regain its power)</p>

<p>If you've come this far, then you probably have enough native talent to become a powerful wizard</p>


<p>Now, let's travel to the wizarding world... (don't foget what you've already learned (write it down!!!!))</p>

<p>Invoke the following spell using your wand:</p>

<code>ssh demo@10.10.10.27</code>

<p>The password is "secret". Type secret when you are prompted to provide a password. In the wizarding world, your password will be invisible, and you will not be able to see the characters as you type them in.
<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>To learn:</p>

<p>SHUT UP AND TYPE ALL OF THIS IN.</p>

<p>You are not going to destroy your computer. You are not going to be thrown into some jail at the bottom of Microsoft's Redmond campus. Your friends won't laugh at you for being a nerd. Simply ignore any stupid weird reasons you have for fearing the command line. "Irrational fear"</p>
